1. to take input from the user we have to use (SCANNER CLASS)
    
      import java.util.Scanner;
      Scanner sd(here sd is the object of the scanner class) = new Scanner(system.in);
      
      here different inputs are there for different data types->
         
           int age = sd.nextInt();
           float age = sd.nextInt();
           String name = sd.nextLine();
