Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game that is played on a 3x3 grid. The goal of the game is to get three of your marks (either "X" or "O") in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does. The game is typically played by taking turns placing your mark on an empty space on the board until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.
